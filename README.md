# percent-letter
Asks user for word and number. If the number is an int, it gives the letter in the word that corresponds to # the number. If the number is a float, it gives the letter at that percentage throughout the word. e.g. If # # the word was Magic, a number of 2 would return 'a', since it's the 2nd letter. A number of .5 would return # 'g' since it is 50% of the way through the word.
